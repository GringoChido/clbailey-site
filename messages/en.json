    "section1Title": "Playing Surface",
    "section1Body": "Brush the cloth after every session using a soft-bristle pool table brush, always moving in one direction. Vacuum gently on a low setting once a month. Never use water, solvents, or household cleaners on the felt. If a spill occurs, blot immediately with a dry cloth. Consider re-felting every 3–5 years depending on usage.",
    "section2Title": "Wood & Finish",
    "section2Body": "Wipe the rails, legs, and frame with a soft, dry microfiber cloth weekly. For deeper cleaning, use a wood-safe furniture polish sparingly. Avoid placing drinks directly on the rails — use coasters. Keep the table out of direct sunlight to prevent fading and warping. Maintain consistent room humidity (40–60%) to prevent wood expansion or contraction.",
    "section3Title": "Slate & Leveling",
    "section3Body": "Check your table's level every 6 months using a machinist's level. Minor adjustments can be made at the leg levelers. If the slate shifts significantly, contact your authorized dealer for professional re-leveling. Never attempt to move a fully assembled table — always have it professionally disassembled and reassembled.",
    "section4Title": "Pockets & Hardware",
    "section4Body": "Inspect pocket liners and bolts quarterly. Tighten any loose hardware gently. If pocket nets show wear or fraying, replacements are available through your dealer. Keep ball return tracks clean and free of debris.",
    "section5Title": "Shuffleboard Care",
    "section5Body": "Apply shuffleboard wax (silicone spray or powder) before each playing session. Clean the playfield with a soft cloth and shuffleboard cleaner monthly. Never use water or abrasive cleaners on the playfield. Check the climatic adjusters seasonally to ensure the board maintains proper concavity. Store pucks flat and clean to prevent surface scoring."
